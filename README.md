# FormantaSass: Core

A Sass Library with style output or not, complete themes could be build using only config values.

It is split into two parts:

- [FormantaSass](https://bitbucket.org/bemit_eu/formantasass), this repo, containing full sets of reusable components
- [FormantaSass: Core](https://bitbucket.org/bemit_eu/formantasass-core), core logic, basic style and utility functions
- Core is independent, whereas FormantaSass (this) relies on Core

## Install

```
composer require bemit/formantasass
composer require bemit/formantasass-core
