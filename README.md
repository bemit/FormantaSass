##Productive or not?
At the moment it is still in development, but in a beta phase, many elements will be added in the near future. The existing components should not be renamed, little changes which will affect the backwards compatibility are possible.

#FormantaSassLibrary 
is the first part of the FormantaLibrary, a Frontend Framework with basic styles and more which we (http://bemit.eu) use at least in every 4th project.  
Our aim is to make these basics as easy and customizable as possible.

Each part could be used on its own or within the complete FormantaLibrary (http://formanta.bemit.eu).

###Licence
The FormantaSassLibrary (like FormantaLibrary) is licenced under the GNU LGPL v3.

Components keep their own licences!

This file and LICENCE.md need to be distributed and not changed when redistributing the library/application or using parts of it.  
For more informations read: LICENCE.md

###Prospects
There will be many changes in the near future, including other Libraries to make Formanta a nicer movement.

We are very happy for your interest and contributing! Let' s form it!
